It is a seperated package to insert walking/standing/sitting humans inside gazebo environment. This package is Adapted from the [servicesim] package which developed by the OpenSourceRoboticsFoundation OSRF. 
To use this package you need to specify:
- The xy-coordinates for each sitting human and his/her direction (yaw angle). This can be done inside *sitting_human_poses.erb* file
- The xy-coordinates for the standing areas (at which standing human will be inserted), and the number of the standing human per each standing area. This can be done inside the *standing_areas.erb* file.
- The trajectories for walking people in terms of xy-waypoints, the number of human that follow each trajectory, and the velocity of the walking human. This can be done inside the *walking_trajectories.erb* file.
After compiling the *actor_sim* package, and specifing the required variables inside the corresponding files, the final code for the humans can be generated using this command
```sh
$ cd src/actor_sim/worlds/actor_world_files
$ erb actor_world_generator.erb >> ../actors_world.world
```
then you can test the world that is generated by the *actor_sim pkg* by launching the *actors_world.launch* file
```sh
roslaunch actor_sim actors_world.launch
```
